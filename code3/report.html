                The basic functionality of the e-basket application had to be done </br>
                using jsp java beans without scriplet.</br>
                
                The interface is a table where the user has to enter the desired quantity</br> 
                of 3 items,coffe,sugar and water in order to get the total amount of the price</br>
                to be paid.</br>
                
                The whole implementation of the application is done in a jsp file</br>
                using an html form where the major jsp javabean commands are embedded.</br></br>
                </p>
                <p>
                A JavaBean is just a Java class that adheres to the following rules,</br>

                it is a public class</br>
                it has a public constructor with no arguments</br>
                it has public get and set methods to read and write to properties.</br></br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                So,for my e-basket i created a two java classes.</br></br>
                One that has setters and getters method for each of the three</br>
                user's choices for the quantity.</br></br>
                And the second that sets the property with the value of the user's</br>
                input for the quantity multiplied by the price,and also has methods to </br>
                get each result and also a method to get the total.</br></br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                
                Inside the jsp file i declare and initialize a bean attribute for each</br>
                class.I set the property for each one of the quantity-inputs.</br>
                
                </p>
                
                So inside my form where i want to have the total result for each item</br>
                i do getProperty with name the name of the second class,and i do the same</br>
                for the whole Total.</br></br>
                
                In order for the quantity that the user has entered to be shown after the user</br>
                has submitted the form,i put getProperty with name the name of the first class,</br>
                in the value of the < input .... /> that every form has.</br>
                ( < input type="text" ....
                                   value="< jsp:getProperty name="Initialbasket" property="qsugar" />"/> </br></br>
                
               I haven't managed to use cookies cause i couldn't set them without using </br>
               scriplet.</br> </br>
               I also parse the the price values from an xml file.</br>
               For the parsing i read from a pdf that i found in web in the </br>
